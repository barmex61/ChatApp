# ChatApp
 Android chat application with kotlin and jetpack features
In this project, I tried to make an application using the Kotlin programming language in android studio. By using fragments and navigation from Jetpack members, I made the application work quickly on a single activity. I did the user login and messaging works using the firebase database. In the application, the photos were displayed using the picasso library. While writing the application, the mvvm model was adhered to.
